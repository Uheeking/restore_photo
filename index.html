                    <p>And thus ye have the inventors and the original of book-licensing ripped up and drawn as lineally
                        as any pedigree. We have it not, that can be heard of, from any ancient state, or polity or
                        church; nor by any statute left us by our ancestors elder or later; nor from the modern custom
                        of any reformed city or church abroad, but from the most anti-christian council and the most
                        tyrannous inquisition that ever inquired.</p>
                    <p> Till then books were ever as freely admitted into the world as any other birth; the issue of the
                        brain was no more stifled than the issue of the womb: no envious Juno sat cross-legged over the
                        nativity of any man's intellectual offspring; but if it proved a monster, who denies, but that
                        it was justly burnt, or sunk into the sea? </p>
                    <p>But that a book, in worse condition than a peccant soul, should be to stand before a jury ere it
                        be born to the world, and undergo yet in darkness the judgment of Radamanth and his colleagues,
                        ere it can pass the ferry backward into light, was never heard before, till that mysterious
                        iniquity, provoked and troubled at the first entrance of Reformation, sought out new limbos and
                        new hells wherein they might include our books also within the number of their damned. And this
                        was the rare morsel so officiously snatched up, and so ill-favouredly imitated by our
                        inquisiturient bishops, and the attendant minorites their chaplains. That ye like not now these
                        most certain authors of this licensing order, and that all sinister intention was far distant
                        from your thoughts, when ye were importuned the passing it, all men who know the integrity of
                        your actions, and how ye honour truth, will clear ye readily.</p>

                        such a universal thing as books are; and when this is done, yet the sin remains entire. Though
                        ye take from a covetous man all his treasure, he has yet one jewel left, ye cannot bereave him

                        wisdom is required to the right managing of this point. Suppose we could expel sin by this
                        means; look how much we thus expel of sin, so much we expel of virtue: for the matter of them
                        both is the same; remove that, and ye remove them both alike.</p>

                        light of the Gospel which is, and is to be, and all this continual preaching, they should still
                        be frequented with such an unprincipled, unedified and laic rabble, as that the whiff of every

                        loose to three sheets of paper without a licenser; that all the sermons, all the lectures
